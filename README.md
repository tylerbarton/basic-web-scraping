# Basic Web Scraping
This project is a very simple demonstration of web scraping targetting [website].

# How To Expand On This
## Continually Scrape (Spider)
Creating a spider involves automatically finding another URL to scrape. While related URL functionality is supplied, one could implement a way to continually loop through these URLs to keep the spider going.

## Handle Static Websites
Some websites have variable HTML items that are changed without reloading the page. [website] is not one of these. Finding a website with this behavior and trying to scrape data from that would be a good exercise. However, this might require a way to monitor for changes and even a way to interact with the page to invoke those changes.

# Why This Project Exists
Through referral, I was recommended to United Airlines cargo department as a data analyst. Through conversation, I was informed the biggest problem the company faced was obtaining data through a third-party database via a web browser for later revenue projections. This process siphoned 16 hours a week out of a single employee which could equate to $25000-30000 a year per employee. The company paid  $75,000 to a consultant but the solution provided was not ideal. Believing I could automate the process, I created this demo for demonstration to upper-management. the salary range was far below my current offer so a deal could not be struck. 

It should be noted that this is not the solution that United Airlines could deploy. In fact, the description of the problem would have required a completely different solution but since management believed this was the issue, this is what I created.
